# Health-Canada-App

Overall, Vision:

Increase efficiency and promote equity and inclusion in the health care industry by
creating a platform where everyone has an equal chance of accessing the healthcare services
quickly and effectively.

Go-to-market strategy/ How to acquire customers:

Partnering with the Canadian Government to onboard healthcare institutions and
encouraging the people to access services catered to their specific needs

Promotion by the Government and the healthcare institutions as this platform increases
efficiency for users on all ends

Work with Telecom and device manufacturers to integrate the app on mobile phones in
Canada

Which needs are we solving:

We are improving the experience of Canadians and promoting inclusion by empowering
the people with accessibility needs to have an equal opportunity to timely and conveniently
schedule their checkups when they want and where they want.

How did you use your strengths and weaknesses to work together as a team?
As fellow students we quickly recognized each other’s strengths and weaknesses. We
worked in organized pairs to highlight such strengths in respective areas
The pairs were allocated to focus on UI design, Backend Systems, and Presentation
Although we split into different focuses the entire group was consulted for ideas and
when substantial changes were to be implemented in any aspect of the project

What have you specifically created during the hackathon?

By assessing our own needs and thinking about needs of the greater Canadian
population we have created the start of a vision of a more advanced and inclusive healthcare
system

The app supports multiple functionalities it allows the storage and monitoring of
medical information and empowers individuals with accessibility needs by making it easier to
book appointments through the app and view results from testing, thus reducing wait times
and promoting inclusivity

What is the next step and resources to develop the MVP (Minimum viable product)

Show the planning and figma designs

We are using android studio and Java

Next steps to make it viable are to add databases to support an increase of users and
add top of the line security features to make sure everyone’s information is as protected as it
can be.
